Module 2


1.1 UK – materialism, substance abuse, family troubles, unemployment, social isolation
US – body image, lack of affordable housing, legal problems, home isolation
Belarus – issues similar to issues of British and American teenagers: bullying, substance abuse, loneliness, materialism
1.2 Identify the problem, think about why is it a problem, brainstorm possible solutions to the problem, evaluate solution to the problem, put the solution into action
1.3 First of all, to solve youth problems, we should identify them, so people who might face these problems would know that they are not alone. Then we should think about reasons why that problem even appeared at the first place. After that we should brainstorm possible solutions to the problem, choose the best one and finally put this solution into action.
1.4 Family plays a great role in teenagers live. It is a place where we learn how to behave, communicate and interact with other people. What takes youth problems, family is probably the safest environment to be yourself, express your feelings and emotions.  Family is where you can be comfortable to share all your problems and find solution to this problem alongside with your family-members.
 
2.1 Tech addictions: trading stocks, TV addiction, screen addiction, cell addiction, video gaming.
Internet addiction: online gambling, online shopping, cyber relationship, social media addiction.
2.2 I think that the main reason why some people became addicted to technology and the Internet is lack of some important aspects of life. For example, some people might not have enough real life human interaction, so they try to find it online. Also some people might find it easier to do something online than in real life. Like online shopping, just few taps on your screen and everything you want to get is at your disposal.
2.3 Positive: saves time in everyday life (online shopping, different devices for house) as long as it is not turning into addiction, helps to communicate with important people that live far from you
Negative: overuse of devices can lead to maybe some laziness because there is nothing you are obligated to do, spending to much time in the internet can lead to distraction from real life, forgetting about real problems that can turn into problems in study, jobs and relationships with other people. In the worst cases it can even lead to some serious psychological damage.
2.4 To avoid these types of addictions you should understand that different devices and the internet are just your helpers and useful supplements in your life. They are not something you can’t live without, they just make your life easier. You should regulate your time spent online, so it won’t lead to addiction and wanting to check your smartphone 24/7.
 
3.1 the most well-known generations that are  the most active now  are
Baby boomers (46-64) the most conservative, devoted to their jobs, appreciate friendly working environment
Generation x (65-79) value workplaces, less conservative than bb, know how to work in teams
Millenials (80-94) achievement-orientated, flexible, collaborative, diverse
Gen z (95- 2012) digital-native, can multi-task, competitive, open-minded, want independence
3.2 first of all we should understand that all people are different, we and, for example our parents, were raised in different times and of course it affected the way we see things. We should be careful with words we say so we won’t hurt people we love. The main key is simple respect, when we respect opinion of each other we can avoid conflicts and live in peace.
3.3 Misunderstanding, discrimination, personality clashes, poor listening, staying unfocused, competition, disrespect to your communication partner
3.4 1) provide variety of communication channels
      2) establish a two-way mentorship programme
      3) put respect front and center
      4) don’t make assumptions
      5) guard against age segregation

Module III ICT Concepts

I

1) The ICT system and other digital devices play the main role in our life because ICT system and digital devices always around us and we often use them. Because its help us in our daily life we can communicate with other people search  some information comfortably sitting in your chair. Also ICT system and devices help in global economic and businesses for example  you can remotely monitor the stock market and communicate remotely.


2) We can use ICT system and digital devices in difference sphere of our live. For working, searching  information, checking social networks, play in  video games , watch movies, learning wireless and so on.


3) Data is any raw fact or observation that describe particular phenomena: temperature, your age, cost. 
   The information is the same data is a series of action or operations that convert data to   useful information. (converted data to useful information)


4) The core characteristic of a modern computer determined by the speed of its processor, also the amount of RAM, and a characteristic of video card . Information from hdd or ssd is transferred to ram and from there to the processor


5) The digital revolution is a widespread transition from analog to digital technologies that began in the 1980s (big computers, personal computer, internet, cloud computing)





II

1) Computer an electronic device for storing and processing data, typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program. The computer is divided into types Workstation, supercomputer, mainframe computer, desktop computer, tablet, laptop and smartphone.

 
2) Computer contained a motherboard, CPU, video card, RAM and ROM, power supply unit and cooling.


3) To computer we can connect devices which can input and output. For example input its mouse keyboard scan microphone; and output its a display, printer, headphones.


4) Proccing device its a CPU(center processing unit) which include  Control Unit, Arithmetic, logic unit and Memory unit. Control unit automates the operation of the computer. Arithmetic and logic unit calculates arithmetic and logical expressions. And Memory unit monitors and manages memory.


5) Computer memory is divided into RAM ROM. ROM is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. RAM is a short-term memory. Cache is a reserved storage location that collects temporary data to help websites, browsers, and apps load faster


6) Secondary storage is divided into SSD and HDD. A hard drive disk is an electro-mechanical data storage device. SSD is a new generation of storage device used in computers. SSD use flash-based memory, which is much faster than a HDD.


III

1) E-waste its high tech trash, electronic scrap and discarded electrical devices.


2) The state of e-waste issue today is terrible, because people continue to throw E-waste into ordinary landfills, which leads to environmental pollution.


3) Electronics are filled with chemicals and substances that are harmful to human health and the environment, including toxic metals, and persistent organic pollutants. If not recycled, these chemicals can contaminate landfills and enter the water supply through leachate.


4) Illegal processing of e-waste brings a good profit, as well as it is quite expensive to recycle of and transport e-waste.


5)| I think  that recycling E-waste is the best way to solve the problem with it because there are precious metals in this garbage that can be given a second life and this can lead to clean the Earth from E-waste. |

|Creation of a network of recycling points; carrying out outreach work; extending the life of devices by repairing |

|Replacing plastics with biodegradable materials, redesigning electronics to reduce the amount of polymers, will reduce the past impact of e-waste.|

Module III. Software Concepts

I

1) There is a software, it consists of system software(drivers, utilities, prog lang) and application software(word, excel, web-browser). System software consists of operating system, programming software and utility software.

2) Prog software is compilers, assemblers, debuggers. Instrument for writing a code.

3) Program to make your pc more efficent and helps configure, analyse and optimise a computer.

4) Computer prog that operates or control a particular type of device.

5) An operating system is a set of programs that lies between applications software
and the computer hardware. OS controls user interface. (The supervisor controls the entire OS and loads into memory other programs (called nonresident))

II

1)
-back up everything.
-put installation DVD into the optical drive
-start BIOS
-set the first boot drive to DVD, reboot again
-agree to the license terms
-after some time, at the end of the process, the OS will ask for the product key and some settings for user accounts

2)
open source :
-freedom from the software vendors.With open source software the org. dont have to follow the software vendor's decisions.
-it can be used and deployed again and again on multiple machines without the need of tracking the license compliance and terms of use.
-help companies save the time and money
-with open source companies have more control of their data.

proprietary software:
-vendor controls software updates
-has restrictions on its use that are delineated by copyright, patents, or license agreements.

3)
-A copyright is a form of legal protection that grants the author of an original work an exclusive right to copy, distribute, sell, modify that work.

-a software "purchase" is actually a license agreement that may include certain restrictions.

-License Agreement is a legal agreement between you and eCourse Corp. for the software product.

4)
If you see on your screen  an error messages appear, you might have a hardware problem. Windows users might face the blue screen of death (also called BSoD), that indicates that the
operating system has encountered an error from which it cannot recover.




III


1) Software piracy is the act of stealing software that is legally protected.


2) Softling, hard disk loading, client-server overuse, counterfeiting,online piracy.

3) Some of the common risks you are exposed to when using unlicensed software include credit card and banking info theft, identity theft, ransomware ( being locked out of your system until you pay the ransom), ad fraud and even risk the quality of your work being compromised. 

4) Countries with weak technological bases have low occurrences of software piracy. According to the Global Software Survey, the U.S., India, and China have the highest cases of software piracy.


5) 
•  Copyrights, patents, and end user agreements 
•  Software product keys
•  Obfuscation
•  Tamper-proof software
•  Software watermarking
